Clean Code - Functions - Testable Html
======================================

This repository show how to refactor a big function to a more readable
code code step by step from Uncle Bob (UB) who is the author of Clean
Code.

Flowing this repository will let you know following questions ?

- How big should a function be? 20 Lines? A screenful? Is there a way
to know if your functions are the right size?

- Object Oriented Design involves the art of breaking applications into
classes. But have you found all the classes in the design of your
application? Is there a way to know?

- Functions are supposed to do "One Thing", do it well, and do it only.
But what is "One Thing". Is there a way to tell if your functions are
obeying that rule?

- The answer to all these questions is yes! And not just with some fuzzy
hand-waving platitudes either. There are fool-proof and unambiguous
answers to these questions.
